# Coding1
A collection of files from my class Coding 1 in the Spring of 2023.

In week 11 we built a program that ran a class called dogs that would show their status and what toy they'd pick using an array. [Run it here](https://replit.com/@SamHein23/Coding-W11-Assignment)

In week 14 we built a program that wtore to and read from files. [Run it here](https://replit.com/@SamHein23/Coding1-W14-Assignment)
